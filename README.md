- ðŸ¤– Built with Expo Web + Next.js.

- ðŸšª Uses **Doorman** for Firebase phone sign-in.

- ðŸŽµ Spotify login.

You can check out the code. It's not super polished, but hey, it works.

# Run the app

It's currently running at https://spotify-party.now.sh.

You can also run it locally. Just clone this repo.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-spotify-party
```

Next, run: 

```sh
yarn
yarn add expo-auth-session
```

Then, follow the instructions to run it on web or mobile:

## Mobile

```
npm i -g expo-cli
expo start
```
 

## Web
```
yarn next
```

# Notes

If you look through the code, you'll notice many blocks that are commented out. That's the product of figuring out Next.js + Expo for a side project. It was also my first time using `styled-components`, so there is some TypeScript jumbling there. ðŸ¦¥
